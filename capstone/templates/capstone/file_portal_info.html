  <h2>Capstone Project: “Simple Lovely Things”</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Simple Lovely Things</strong> — a cozy space where you can collect your favorite files that bring joy, spark memories, or simply make you smile. It’s not about exchanging files — it’s about saving the things you love, whether it’s a photo, a book, a song, or a funny gif. Just your own digital treasure box.
  </p>

  <p>
    The site is divided into three main areas:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>My Collection</strong> — your personal collection of files.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared Files</strong> — a space where users can share their favorite files with the community.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin Panel</strong> — for moderators and superusers to manage categories and approve shared content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On larger screens, all available blocks are displayed side by side. If you’re a superuser, you’ll see all three. If you’re a regular user, you’ll see only the first two. On mobile, the blocks become buttons stacked vertically for easy navigation.
  </p>

  <h3>Inside the Project</h3>

  <h4>🛠 Admin Panel</h4>
  <p>
    This area is only visible to superusers and is the starting point for setting up the site. It’s where categories are created, managed, and where shared files go through moderation before they appear in the Shared Files.
  </p>

  <p>The Admin Panel has three sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📁 <strong>Create Categories</strong></li>
    <li>🧩 <strong>Manage Categories</strong></li>
    <li>👁️ <strong>Review Shared Files</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Creating Categories</h5>
  <p>
    To add a new <strong>main category</strong> (like “Books”), click <em>Add Category</em>. In the first dropdown, leave it set to <em>Null</em> to mark it as a top-level category. Then, enter allowed file extensions (like <code>.txt, .doc, .odt</code>) and give it a name.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a <strong>subcategory</strong> (like “Detective” under “Books”), select the parent category in the first dropdown, and just enter the name of the subcategory in the second field.
  </p>

  <h5>Managing Categories</h5>
  <p>
    Each main category shows up as a small control panel with options to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the name to view its subcategories</li>
    <li>Delete the category</li>
    <li>Update the list of allowed file extensions</li>
    <li>See the current file extensions assigned to it</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Reviewing Shared Files</h5>
  <p>
    When someone shares a file, it doesn’t appear in the Shared Files immediately. It goes into a moderation queue. The <strong>Files</strong> button shows how many pending items there are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the button opens a modal window (or full-screen view on mobile), where files are grouped by category. Each file card includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Play</strong> — depending on the file type</li>
    <li><strong>DeleteFromDb</strong> — removes the request, not the file itself</li>
    <li><strong>Approve</strong> — publishes the file to the Shared Files</li>
    <li><strong>Reject</strong> — denies the request</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can also preview all files in a category using the <strong>Open All</strong> carousel viewer.
  </p>

  <h4>💖 My Collection</h4>
  <p>
    This is your personal space to upload and store files that matter to you. You can upload anything you like — as long as the file is no larger than <strong>10 MB</strong>, and your total storage stays under <strong>100 MB</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the top of the block, you’ll see a progress bar showing how full your storage is.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section has two main parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Add Files</strong></li>
    <li><strong>View Files</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Adding New Files</h5>
  <p>
    Click the <strong>Add Files</strong> button to start. First, choose a category. Then, pick one or more subcategories. Once that’s done, the file upload form will appear where you can enter a title, description, and choose your file.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you try to upload a file with an unsupported extension — don’t worry — you’ll get a helpful error message.
  </p>

  <h5>Viewing Files</h5>
  <p>
    You’ll see buttons for each category with a count of how many files you’ve uploaded. Click a button to open a modal window (or full-screen view on mobile). Here’s what you can expect:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Books — displayed as a page-by-page carousel, including support for <code>.fb2</code> format</li>
    <li>Music — played with built-in audio controls</li>
    <li>Videos — played using a video viewer</li>
    <li>Images — displayed in a gallery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every file card has options like <strong>Delete</strong> and <strong>Share</strong>. If you click <em>Share</em>, the file enters the moderation process, and you’ll see its status directly on the card.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are also additional controls in the modal view, like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open All</strong> — view files as a slideshow</li>
    <li><strong>Close View</strong> — exit viewer mode</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you've saved a link to someone else’s shared file, it won’t take up your storage. Instead of the usual <strong>Delete</strong> button, you’ll see <strong>Remove from list</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>🌍 Shared Files</h4>
  <p>
    This is the shared space where users can see what others have chosen to share. Every file here has passed admin moderation.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the top, you can choose how many files to display per page and use filters to sort by subcategory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below that is a scrollable list of files — newest first. Each file card shows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The username of the uploader</li>
    <li>Category and basic info</li>
    <li>Preview or playback of the file</li>
    <li>Buttons to save a link to your own collection</li>
    <li>A comment section (with comment count)</li>
    <li>A Like button with the number of likes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If there are lots of files, you’ll see pagination controls at the bottom.
  </p>
